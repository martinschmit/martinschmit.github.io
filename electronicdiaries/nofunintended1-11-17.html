<font size="17">If you're in your twenties and starting to think, "I don't have a fucking clue what I'm doing. Gas might be cheaper but that means nothing because
I still can't afford that Ford Pinto/motorcycle+sidecar/Razor scooter I've been ogling" then don't worry. I'm in that boat with you. Just the other day,
I looked at the window of a building that was under construction, saw the word "Chase" in big blue letters, and thought to myself, 'Oh, come onnnnn. There's 
already a Chase right across the street.' It was a reflection and, on that day, I was a male Baubo. That being said, let this mere website be a minor 
reflection of myself.</font>
