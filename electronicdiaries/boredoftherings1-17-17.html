<font size="15">It's Friday the 13th and I'm sitting on the couch in my apartment, post-dinner. Donning computer blue sweatpants with a bag of Hot Cheetos at the 
ready while an episode of Twin Peaks is on the cusp of commencing. A billowing tapestry of "A Friend In Need" hangs above me, not only an ever-relevant piece of 
culture but also an affirmation of my being single in an age where marriage seems to be trending every god damn day. I, like many others, decry this. We are Bored of 
the Rings.
<br>
Now don't get me wrong, I want to get married. I want a wife and I want to do everything I can to keep her happy which, surprise, sometimes includes doing absolutely 
nothing. I want kids and I want to raise them and encourage them to be their truest selves. Not Dexter's dad-encouraging-his-son-to-serial-kill-other-serial-killers 
level but you get the point. That being said, I don't think people should get married when having their GPA on their resume still seems like it makes sense. People 
should get married after they learn to appreciate life and the profound idea of spending that life with another person. Not after they get a raise at work and they can 
finally afford a higher tier of venues.
