<font size="15">If you're in your twenties and starting to think, "I don't have a fucking clue what I'm doing. Gas might be cheaper but that means nothing because
I still can't afford that Ford Pinto/motorcycle+sidecar/Razor scooter I've been ogling" then don't worry. I'm in that boat with you. Just the other day,
I looked at the window of a building that was under construction, saw the word "Chase" in big blue letters, and thought to myself, "Oh, come onnnnn. There's 
already a Chase right across the street." It was a reflection of Chase from across the street and, on that day, I was Cpt. Dunce. We all make mistakes 
and Brendan Fraser made Dudley Do Right hence we definitely all make mistakes. That being said, let this mere website be a minor reflection of myself, with occasional 
mistakes and a myriad of mishaps and misfortune.</font>
